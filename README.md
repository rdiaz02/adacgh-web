# adacgh-web
ADaCGH-web: web-based analysis of aCGH data.

This is code for running ADaCGH2 on the web, as in our 
[adacgh2 web app](http://adacgh2.iib.uam.es). 


Code for ADaCGH2
================

The code for the the [BioConductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) package
[ADaCGH2](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/ADaCGH2.html) 
is available from one of the subdirectories. It is that way, because that
is how development took place and for various other historical reasons.
That code, however, is left there just for tracking and historical purposes
but is outdated. Please see
the github repo for [adacgh2](https://github.com/rdiaz02/adacgh2).
