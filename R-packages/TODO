Hi,

I just would like to make a small suggestion on your CRAN package

 http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ADaCGH/index.html

 If a user will never use or has problems installing, say, GLAD, you
 package still requires the user to have it.  If you instead put GLAD
 under "Suggests:" and use

  require("GLAD") || stop("Package not loaded: GLAD");

  at the two of the wrapper function, the user can install your package
  and use the other segmentation methods.

  This might solve the problem of not having binaries for OSX/Windows, e.g.

   http://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-patched-macosx-ix86/ADaCGH-00check.html

   Cheers

   Henrik
